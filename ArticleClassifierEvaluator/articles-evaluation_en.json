Say the same thing to your Mac, however, and Siri responds in a more multitasking-friendly way by appearing in a small window in the corner of the screen, allowing you to drag and drop retrieved items from it.\n\n\n\niPad concept of improved Siri behavior (image via iHelp BR)\n\nThis less disruptive, more functional implementation of Siri in macOS may well be coming to iPad, although it's unlikely to appear in the first version of iPadOS, which is due to be released this fall. The possibility was hinted at by Craig Federighi, Apple's VP of software engineering, in response to an email sent to him by Apple user Juliano Rossi. \n\n\n\nResponding to Rossi's request that Siri on iPadOS behaves like on the Mac, without filling the entire screen, Federighi wrote:\n\n\"Hi Juliano,\n\n\n\nThanks for the note. Really glad that you enjoyed the keynote.\n\n\n\nWhat you describe is certainly valid feedback. Unfortunately, it's not something we can add in at the last minute, but we will certainly consider it for the future. \n\n\n\nThanks for caring!\n\n\n\n- craig\"Craig replied me back! 😳The mail was about my request for Siri on iPad to behave like on the Mac, without filling the entire screen.Well, maybe next year. pic.twitter.com\/7xIgxDB7hf— Juliano Rossi (@_JulianoRossi) June 9, 2019  \n\nAs Federighi's response suggests, adding this less intrusive Siri behavior would require some significant changes to the OS, so it's not something that could be included at this late stage in software testing. But as Portuguese tech blog iHelp BR notes, it's at least good to know that Apple is aware of the legitimate request, which would bring iPadOS even closer to the macOS experience. \n\n\n\nApple often considers user feedback, but sometimes takes a while to act on it. For instance, the company eventually responded to multiple user requests that it change the volume level indicator in iOS. When pressing the volume buttons on iPhone or iPad running iOS 12 or earlier, the volume indicator displays in the center of the screen, obscuring content. As of iOS 13, coming this fall, the indicator is smaller and appears at the side of the display in a less intrusive manner.  \n\n\n\nUnveiled last week during Apple's WWDC keynote, iPadOS is designed to bring more desktop-class functionality to iPads with bigger screens. iPadOS will incorporate several features that recognize the tablet's function as a potential computer replacement, including a new Home screen, an updated Split View to enhance multitasking, and improved Apple Pencil support.Related Roundups: iOS 13, iPadOSThis article, \"Apple Considering Less Disruptive Siri Behavior in Future Version of iPadOS\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n \n","themes":[]},{"title":"'Sky: Children of the Light' Coming to iOS on July 11, Now Available to Pre-Order on the App Store","summary":"Sky: Children of the Light, by Journey developer thatgamecompany, is officially launching on July 11 for iOS.

Razer's Chroma technology lets you choose from more than 16 million colors for your Core X lighting.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with eGPU enclosures, Razer's options are designed to provide notebook owners a way to play desktop class games and take advantage of a more powerful GPU for GPU-intensive tasks.\n\n\n\neGPU enclosures do not come with a GPU included -- you'll need to add your own -- but Razer's model is compatible a with range of desktop PCIe graphics cards, including NVIDIA GeForce RTX, GeForce GTX, and Quadro cards along with AMD XConnect-enabled Radeon and Radeon Pro cards. Mac users will, of course, want to use AMD graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core X Chroma, priced at $300, is similar to Razer's previous Core X eGPU enclosure, and is compatible with Thunderbolt 3-equipped PCs and Macs, including Apple's Thunderbolt 3 notebooks. It features a black aluminum casing with a side window that shows off the aforementioned Chroma lighting.\n\n\n\nGraphics cards can be inserted using a simple drawer-style slide and lock mechanism and a single thumbscrew, so it's simple enough that even a non-technical person can use it. Once your graphics card is installed, all you need to do to use it is plug the Core X Chroma into the Thunderbolt 3 port on your Mac. There's a dual-chip feature in the Core X Chroma for handling graphic and peripheral data all with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core X Chroma features a Gigabit Ethernet port, along with four USB 3.1 Type-A ports. It supports up to 3 slot-wide desktop graphics cards that require up to 500W of power, and for Macs, it supplies up to 100W of power for charging purposes. There are open vents and cooling features to optimize thermal performance.\n\n\n\nBecause of the Chroma technology inside, the Core X Chroma matches up well with Razer's other Chroma-enabled products, from keyboards to notebooks, but you don't need Razer devices to use the Core X Chroma.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have two of the Core X Chroma eGPU enclosures to give away to MacRumors readers.

As usual, Apple says all kids must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian for the duration of their visits.\n\n\n\nLast year's summer camp ran between July 9 and July 27, with sessions taking place on weekdays between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. local time. Multi-day programs included coding with Sphero robots, beat making and songwriting with GarageBand, and recording and editing short videos with Apple's Clips app for iPad.\n\n\n\nFor a potential sneak peek, we can look at Singapore, where Apple Camp has been renamed to Apple Summer Camp ahead of its kickoff next week. There, it looks like the programs will be familiar this year:Creating Your Own Song with GarageBand\n\nIn this three-day session, kids aged 8–12 explore how to build their own song.

It's a useful function that works well, but it's also something that third-party companies have been doing for several years now.\n\n\n\nOne of those companies makes the Luna Display, a hardware-based dongle that plugs into the Mac to turn the iPad into a secondary display. According to Luna Display's founders, though Sidecar offers similar connected technology, the Luna Display is sticking around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not going anywhere,\" wrote CEO Matt Ronge and Head of Product Giovanni Donelli in a blog post shared this afternoon. The two go on to explain that while they're disappointed in Apple's decision, they plan to continue to cater to creative professionals.We've spent the last five years building innovative products like Astropad and Luna Display that cater to true creative professionals.

As highlighted by The Verge's Dieter Bohn in his brief testing of Google Docs, Apple has made it possible to use touch to hit the menu buttons. \n\nGoogle Docs has long been a huge problem on the iPad, for two reasons. First, Google’s own iPad app is god-awful and the company seems hell-bent on not updating it to work better. Second, Google Docs in Safari on the iPad right now redirects you to that app even if you “Request Desktop Site.”\n\n\n\nOn iPadOS, however, Google Docs in Safari seems great.\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, I only spent about five minutes poking around, but I went straight for the stuff I didn’t expect to work at all — and it worked. Keyboard shortcuts for formatting and header styling, comments, cursor placement, and even watching real-time edits from another person in the doc all worked.For the productivity suite, Safari for iPadOS seems to be re-rendering the web-based interface to align it more with the site's desktop functionality. Granted, we don't know yet how far this optimization extends – is it only available for a handful of commonly used desktop sites, for example, or will Apple's implementation be more extensible? – but it's at least a sign that Apple is doing a lot under the hood to make Safari on iPad more of a desktop-class user experience.\n\n\n\niPadOS will incorporate several features that recognize the tablet's function as a potential computer replacement, including a new Home screen, an updated Split View to enhance multitasking, improved Apple Pencil support, and additional keyboard shortcuts for use with physical keyboards. iPadOS is due to get its public release in the fall.Related Roundups: iOS 13, iPadOSThis article, \"Safari on iPadOS Optimized to Work With at Least Some Desktop Versions of Websites\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n \n","themes":[]},{"title":"iOS 13 Lets You Send Unknown Callers Straight to Voicemail","summary":"In the Phone section of the Settings app in iOS 13, there's an interesting new toggle called \"Silence Unknown Callers,\" which appears to do exactly what the name suggests. With this feature enabled, calls received by people not in your contacts list seem to be sent straight to voicemail.\n\n\n\nWe tested out the Silence Unknown Callers feature this week, and it worked well. When an iPhone with the option enabled received a call from a number that wasn't a known number in contacts, the phone never rang - the call was sent directly to voicemail.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we haven't done extensive testing, we did try introducing an unknown number by referencing it in an email because iOS can recognize phone numbers that way, but even when the number had been previously sent to us, phone calls from that number were still muted.\n\n\n\nSilence Unknown Callers seems to be an effective way to limit incoming calls to numbers that you already know, blocking out the rest from causing your phone to ring.\n\n\n\nIt's a simple, useful solution to the deluge of spam calls that many of us in the United States receive on a daily basis. It's not identifying spam calls or risky numbers specifically so it's not the most elegant solution available, but it works for cutting down on unwanted calls.\n\n\n\nThis isn't a setting that you're going to want to enable if you're worried about missing some legitimate calls from numbers that you don't know, but all calls do go to voicemail, so when a legitimate call does come in, you can just call the person back.\n\n\n\nSilence Unknown Callers will be available to everyone this fall when iOS 13 launches alongside new iPhones.Related Roundups: iOS 13, iPadOSThis article, \"iOS 13 Lets You Send Unknown Callers Straight to Voicemail\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n \n","themes":[]},{"title":"Craig Federighi on iPad's Long-Awaited External Drive Support: 'We're Willing to Acknowledge the 1990s'","summary":"On the latest episode of the AppStories podcast, MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci sat down with Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi to discuss WWDC 2019 announcements, including Project Catalyst, SwiftUI, and iPadOS.\n\n\n\nCraig Federighi at WWDC 2019\n\nProject Catalyst will make it much easier for developers to extend iPad apps to the Mac. In many cases, adding macOS support to an iPad app is as easy as opening an Xcode project and clicking the Mac checkbox, although Apple encourages developers to further optimize their apps to offer a true Mac experience.\n\n\n\nFederighi believes Project Catalyst will allow many developers to bring their iPad apps to the Mac, as Apple has bridged the gap between its UIKit framework for iOS apps and its AppKit framework for Mac apps:UIKit and AppKit always remained these two separate worlds, and depending on what a developer did, they could build an app that was sort of factored in a way that they shared a lot of cross-platform code, but they had to always take that extra step of having people on the team that knew AppKit, people on the team that knew UIKit, and make the decision to specialize for those two. And for many developers, they chose one or the other and not both, because that was a real effort to get the expertise and to make the investment.Project Catalyst\n\nFederighi expressed excitement about Project Catalyst, noting that he has seen many apps that look fantastic on the iPad that he has wanted on the Mac. With macOS Catalina and Xcode 11, that is now a possibility, with Twitter being one of several companies that plans to extend their iPad app to the Mac.\n\n\n\nHe added that Project Catalyst gives Apple the \"same kind of benefits of being able to have a single team that can focus on making one thing the best and release it across all of our platforms,\" which makes \"a ton of sense\" to the company.\n\n\n\nSwiftUI\n\nAs for Apple's new SwiftUI framework, which enables developers to use easy-to-understand declarative code to create full-featured user interfaces, Federighi said giving developers a tool that is \"that expressive and that interactive\" is going to result in better ideas and thereby better apps moving forward:SwiftUI will make development of UI more accessible to many people who maybe weren't approaching it before, and that's exciting, because we're already seeing some of that with Swift and Swift Playgrounds. But even for the most experienced of developers, giving them a tool that is that expressive and that interactive is going to mean they're going to build better things, they're going to try out better ideas, and that's going to result in better apps.Turning to the new iPadOS platform, Federighi said that the iPad has \"become something really distinct from the phone\" over the years and, accordingly, was deserving of an operating system that provides a \"distinct experience\":Things like Drag and Drop, Split View, Slide Over, Apple Pencil… these are things that really define a different way of working with the device. When I work on my iPad, I don't feel like I'm working on a big phone… or like I'm working on a Mac. I feel like I'm working on an iPad. What we mean when we say macOS, or when we say tvOS, which is an iOS-based platform, or when we say watchOS, which at its core is iOS, these things to us are definitions of experiences. There's a watchOS experience that's tailored for apps that make sense on your wrist. tvOS, a 10-foot UI that makes sense in that context. iPadOS has become a distinct experience. We've been working our way there steadily over time. With the work we did this year, we felt like we were at a place where this truly was a distinct thing.iPads now fully support external drives\n\nHumorously, Federighi also poked fun at the iPad's newly added support for external storage such as USB drives and SD cards:External drives. We're willing to acknowledge the 1990s and go all the way back. You know, people still use them sometimes. I'm an AirDrop fan myself, but I understand there are other uses… we know with photographers, the ability to import their photos directly into an app like Lightroom is so important.The full interview can be listened to on the AppStories podcast over at MacStories.Related Roundup: iPad ProTags: Craig Federighi, SwiftUI, Project CatalystBuyer's Guide: 11\" iPad Pro (Neutral), 12.9\" iPad Pro (Neutral)This article, \"Craig Federighi on iPad's Long-Awaited External Drive Support: 'We're Willing to Acknowledge the 1990s'\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n \n","themes":[]},{"title":"Apple's Big Push to Improve Accessibility in iOS 13, iPadOS, and macOS Catalina","summary":"Apple is introducing several accessibility-friendly features with iOS 13, iPadOS, and macOS Catalina, including Voice Control, Hover Text, and Mouse Pointer Support for iPhones and iPads. \n\n\n\nAfter the company's WWDC keynote on Monday, TechCrunch's iOS accessibility expert Steven Aquino sat down with Apple's Sarah Herrlinger, director of Global Accessibility Policy & Initiatives, who offered further details on the thinking behind Apple's latest, and arguably greatest, accessibility push.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoice Control\n\nHerrlinger first opened up about Apple's new Voice Control feature, which earned its own slide space during Craig Federighi’s onstage presentation. Voice Control supports editing and menu navigation in both macOS Catalina and iOS 13, but it was the feature's advanced dictation capabilities that Herrlinger was most eager to highlight. \n\nFor example, Herrlinger explained how you can say \"show numbers\" in Safari's Favorites view and little numbers, corresponding to the number of favorites you have, show up beside a website's favicon. Say TechCrunch is No. 2 in your list of favorites. If the glyph is hard to make out visually, saying \"open 2\" will prompt Voice Control to launch TechCrunch's page. Likewise, you can say \"show grid\" and a grid will appear so you perform actions such as clicking, tapping or pinching-and-zooming.Herrlinger said Apple has worked hard to improve Voice Control's speech detection system, so that it can more adeptly parse users with different types of speech, such as those who stutter. \n\n\n\nOn iOS, the feature also utilizes attention awareness to know when a user with physical motor limitations is interacting with their device. Allaying privacy concerns, Apple says that none of the audio processed by Voice Control can be accessed by anyone else, including Apple, thanks to built-in anonymity and encryption.\n\n\n\nHover Text for macOS\n\nAnother feature Herrlinger was keen to demo was something called Hover Text on macOS. Described as a subset of the existing Zoom functionality, Hover Text enables the user to place the mouse pointer over a selection of text to get a bubble with the text enlarged.\n\nHerrlinger told me the feature works system-wide, even in places like the menu bar. And yes, Hover Text is indeed customizable; users have access to a wide variety of fonts and colors to make Hover Text's \"bubbles\" their own. Text size can be enlarged up to 128pt, Herrlinger said. What this means is users can play with different permutations of the feature to find which label(s) work best — say, a yellow background with dark blue text set in Helvetica for the highest contrast. The possibilities are virtually endless, a testament to how rich the feature is despite its simplicity.According to Herrlinger, Apple could have brought iOS feature Dynamic Type to the Mac, but found Hover Text accomplished the same goal of enlarging text in a way that felt better suited to its desktop operating system.\n\n\n\nMouse Support for iPhone and iPad\n\niPadOS and iOS 13 introduces mouse support for the first time, allowing a USB mouse to be connected to an iPad and iPhone for the first time. \n\n\n\nMouse support is not a standard feature, but is instead available as an AssistiveTouch option, designed for users with physical motor delays who can’t easily interact with the touchscreen itself. Apple says it works with both USB and Bluetooth mice, although the company doesn’t yet have an official compatibility list. According to developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who first discovered the feature, it also works with the Apple Magic Trackpad. \n\nWhen I asked why build pointer support into a touch-based operating system, Herrlinger was unequivocal in her answer: it serves a need in the accessibility community. \"This is not your old desktop cursor as the primary input method,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe reality is, it's not your secondary choice, either. The bottom line is that, while Apple loves the idea of accessibility features being adopted by the mainstream, pointer support in iOS 13 and iPadOS really isn't the conventional PC input mechanism at all. In this case, it's a niche feature that should suit a niche use case; it's not supposed to represent the milestone of iPad's productivity growth that many think it could be. Maybe that changes over time, but for now, it's the new Mac Pro of software: not for everyone, not even for most people.According to Herrlinger, Apple recognizes that people without disabilities will use this feature. \"For example, many people find value in closed captions,\" she said. \"Our goal is to engineer for specific use cases so that we continue to bring the power of our devices to more people.\"\n\n\n\nHello mouse support on iOS 13! It’s an AssistiveTouch feature, and works with USB mice. @viticci nailed this pic.twitter.com\/nj6xGAKSg0— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) June 3, 2019  \n\nThat being said, Herrlinger was quick to emphasize that mouse support should be seen in context. In other words, Apple hasn't introduced it to drastically alter the primary user input landscape of iOS, although that being said, it's not going to stop anyone outside its intended use case from plugging a mouse into their iPad Pro. \n\n\n\niOS 13, iPadOS, and macOS Catalina are only available to registered developers at this time, but later in the summer, Apple plans to make public betas available, giving public beta testers a chance to try the software before it sees a public launch in the fall.Related Roundups: iOS 13, iPadOSTag: accessibilityThis article, \"Apple's Big Push to Improve Accessibility in iOS 13, iPadOS, and macOS Catalina\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n \n","themes":[]},{"title":"Apple's Secure Video HomeKit Feature Requires a 200GB or 2TB iCloud Storage Plan","summary":"Apple at WWDC announced a new HomeKit feature called HomeKit Secure Video, which is designed to offer up a better, more secure way to manage the footage captured by in-home security cameras.\n\n\n\nAs Apple's Craig Federighi explained on stage when announcing the feature, many current home security cameras upload data to the cloud for analysis to enable features like motion detection.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameras that support HomeKit Secure Video will leverage the iPad, Apple TV, or HomePod (aka Home Hub devices) to analyze video right in your home. Video feeds will be encrypted end-to-end and uploaded to iCloud where you and you alone will be able to see the footage.\n\n\n\nLike existing home security cameras, Apple will send you notifications if activity is detected so recordings can be reviewed; the entire process is just more secure.\n\n\n\nApple is providing 10 days of \"free\" iCloud storage for video content that will not count against your iCloud data plan limits, but as announced on Monday, a higher-end iCloud storage plan is required.\n\n\n\nFor one Secure Video camera, a 200GB iCloud storage plan is required, while you need the 2TB plan for up to 5 cameras. In the United States, 200GB of storage is priced at $2.99 per month, while 2TB of storage is priced at $9.99 per month.\n\n\n\nMany camera companies that offer cloud storage do charge monthly fees for data access, so Apple's decision to require a $2.99 to $9.99 per month fee isn't a major surprise, and a lot more utility is provided with an Apple iCloud storage plan than one from Logitech or Eufy.\n\n\n\nApple says that Netatmo, Logitech, and Eufy will be among the first companies to provide cameras with HomeKit Secure Video support, suggesting new hardware is required to take advantage of the Secure Video capabilities.\n\n\n\nAlong with HomeKit Secure Video, Apple also announced HomeKit for routers, which will provide further protection for your smart devices. HomeKit for routers will firewall off each device so if one is compromised, the others will remain safe. Linksys, Eero, and Charter Spectrum will be the first companies to offer HomeKit-compatible routers.\n\n\n\nApple made a few other changes to the Home app that are worth checking out for those invested in HomeKit, which can be seen into our deep dive of the Home app in iOS 13.Related Roundups: iOS 13, iPadOSTag: HomeKitThis article, \"Apple's Secure Video HomeKit Feature Requires a 200GB or 2TB iCloud Storage Plan\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums\n \n","themes":[]},{"title":"macOS Catalina's 'Sidecar' Feature for Turning the iPad Into a Second Display Limited to Newer Macs","summary":"Apple in macOS Catalina introduced a new feature called Sidecar, which is designed to turn an iPad into a second display for a Mac, either extending what's on the screen or mirroring the content.\n\n\n\nApple hasn't yet provided details on which devices will work with Sidecar, but developer Steve Troughton-Smith was able to find some details by digging into macOS Catalina's code.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, Sidecar is limited to many of Apple's newer Macs, and the devices listed below will be able to use it.\n\n\n\n \tLate 2015 27\" iMac or newer\n\n2017 iMac Pro\n\n \tMid 2016 MacBook Pro or newer\n\n \tLate 2018 Mac mini or newer\n\n \tLate 2018 MacBook Air or newer\n\n \tEarly 2016 MacBook or newer\n\n \t2019 Mac Pro\n\n\n\nIt's not clear if this is a complete list, but Troughton-Smith says a long list of older machines are blacklisted from taking advantage of the feature. Some older Macs that are not greenlit for Sidecar can still use the feature via the Terminal command provided by Troughton-Smith, but there's no complete list on exactly which older Macs the Terminal command works with.\n\n\n\nSidecar supports iMac 27\" (Late 2015) or newer, MacBook Pro (2016) or newer, mac Mini (2018), Mac Pro (2019), MacBook Air (2018) , MacBook (Early 2016 or newer), and blacklists all the devices in the screenshot pic.twitter.com\/DHNDyI98WV— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) June 5, 2019  \n\nThere's no word on whether all iPads will work with Sidecar, or if there will be limitations on that end as well. iPadOS, required for Sidecar, runs on The iPad Air 2 and later, the iPad mini 4 and later, the 5th-generation iPad and later, and all iPad Pro models.\n\n\n\nThe oldest of these iPads, the iPad mini 4 and the iPad Air 2, use A8 and A8X chips respectively, while the newer models all use more powerful chips.\n\n\n\nUpdate: According to a MacRumors reader who has used the feature, Sidecar works well with the iPad Air 2, which means it should also work with all other iPads that are compatible with iOS 13.

The introduction of iPadOS. And of course, the new Mac Pro.But the theme of the show was a familiar one: privacy. For the past several years, Apple has hammered home its belief in our devices and data staying in our hands, but at WWDC, Apple put its privacy where its mouth is.
